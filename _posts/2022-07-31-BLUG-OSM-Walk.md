After [yesterday's]({% link _posts/2022-07-30-Belfast-Pride-Parade.md %}) great party, Christine and I went for a more relaxed Sunday Morning walk with the [BLUG Crew](https://www.meetup.com/belfast-lug/) to have a go at improving the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data of the [Ulster Folk Museum](https://www.nmni.com/Ulster-Folk-Museum/Home.aspx).

While apparently someone already went through and catalogued most of the buildings, we had a good time exploring [Vespucci](https://vespucci.io/) and gathering some GPX traces to (im)prove the accuracy of the existing paths.
